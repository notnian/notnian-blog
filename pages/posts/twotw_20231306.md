## Tool/Technology Spotlight
Setting up a project from scratch takes time, so if you happen to bootstrap a lot of small projects, take a look at this beautiful Next.Js boilerplate.

  - I'll let you check out the main features on the github repo. üòâ

üï∏Ô∏è For scrapping addicts, an interesting tool "designed to gather text on the Web", thanks to korben for his article on it. I'm thinking of using it to summarize content of pages with AI.
